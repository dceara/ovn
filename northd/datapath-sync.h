/* Datapath syncing API. This file consists of utility functions
 * that can be used when syncing northbound datapath types (e.g.
 * Logical_Router and Logical_Switch) to southbound Datapath_Bindings.
 *
 * The basic flow of data is as such.
 * 1. A northbound type is converted into an ovn_unsynced_datapath.
 * All ovn_unsynced_datapaths are placed into an ovn_unsynced_datapath_map.
 * 2. The en_datapath_sync node takes all of the maps in as input and
 * syncs them with southbound datapath bindings. This includes allocating
 * tunnel keys across all datapath types. The output of this node is
 * ovn_synced_datapaths, which contains a list of all synced datapaths.
 * 3. A northbound type-aware node then takes the ovn_synced_datapaths,
 * and decodes the generic synced datapaths back into a type-specific
 * version (e.g. ovn_synced_logical_router). Later nodes can then consume
 * these type-specific synced datapath types in order to perform
 * further processing.
 *
 * Incremental processing throws an interesting wrinkle to the mix.
 * When northbound logical datapaths are new, the datapath_sync node
 * inserts a new Datapath_Binding into the southbound database. The
 * new synced datapath is added to a "pending" hmap of synced datapaths.
 * Once the southbound database sends its update showing the inserted
 * Datapath_Binding, then the synced datapath is moved from the "pending"
 * hmap to the "synced_dps" hmap. The engine nodes that process synced
 * datapaths only pay attention to the synced datapaths in the "synced_dps"
 * hmap. This means that consumers of synced logical switches or synced
 * logical routers will be informed of "new" synced datapaths after the
 * northbound IDL has reported the logical router or logical switch as
 * new. This means that the nbrec_logical_switch_is_new() and
 * nbrec_logical_router_is_new() functions cannot be used to detect if
 * a logical switch or logical router is new. Instead, consumers of
 * synced datapath types can tell if the datapath is new by its
 * presence in the "new" hmapx of the synced logical datapath map.
 *
 * The reason this is done is to ensure that valid southbound
 * datapath binding pointers are provided to all engine nodes. If we
 * provided the southbound datapath binding at the time of insertion,
 * then the pointer would go out of scope when the IDL is run next. By
 * waiting for an updated from the southbound database, we get a more
 * permanent pointer to the southbound datapath binding that is safe
 * to cache.
 *
 * For updated or deleted northbound logical datapaths, there is no
 * such delay. The update or deletion is passed to downstream engine
 * nodes in the same IDL run when they are detected as being updated
 * or deleted in the northbound database. Therefore, the
 * nbrec_logical_switch_is_deleted() and nbrec_logical_router_is_deleted()
 * functions are still valid to call from consumers of synced datapath
 * engine nodes.
